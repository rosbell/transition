  <h1>Clipboard API: event demonstration</h1>

  <p>This page uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/Web/API/Clipboard_API">Clipboard API</a> events.</p>


  <h2>Copy</h2>

  <p>Any text on this page can be selected then:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>copied with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>|<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd></li>
    <li>cut with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>|<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The cut/copy event makes the clipboard text uppercase. Try pasting it into another application such as a text editor.</p>


  <h2>Paste</h2>

  <form action="#">

    <p>
      <label for="field1" class="block">Paste here using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>|<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>:</label>
      <textarea id="field1" rows="10" cols="40"></textarea>
    </p>

    <button type="reset">clear</button>

    <p>Text pasted into this box replaces the entire content and adds a 'pasted:' label.</p>

  </form>

<script type="module">
const body = document.body;

body.addEventListener('cut', cutCopyHandler);
body.addEventListener('copy', cutCopyHandler);

document.getElementById('field1').addEventListener('paste', pasteEvent);


// cut or copy event handler
function cutCopyHandler(e) {

  const selection = document.getSelection();
  e.clipboardData.setData('text/plain', selection.toString().toUpperCase());

  if (e.type === 'cut') selection.deleteFromDocument();

  e.preventDefault();

}


// paste event handler
function pasteEvent(e) {

  const paste = 'pasted:\n' + (e.clipboardData || window.clipboardData).getData('text');

  e.target.value = paste;

  e.preventDefault();
}

</script>
